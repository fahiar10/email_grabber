# email_grabber

Step 1:
  Copy text to your clipboard that contains email addresses you would like segregated.

Step 2:
  Run the file 'email re.py' using python. (Remember to pip install the modules re and pyperclip if not present)

Step 3:
  Email addresses are now copied back to your clipboard that you can paste anywhere.
  
Note: A very simple regular expression is used to match email strings and this does not guarantee the credibility of the mail and is not 100% accurate :)
